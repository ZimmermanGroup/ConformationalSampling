Notes for running Z conformer search

test.xyz: contains ligand xyz file
target.xyz: contains metal center
CHARGE1: contains charge of target
CHARGE2: contains charge of test (ligand)

setupbcat: local variables
progress.log: calculations

all.xyz: output file with nonoptimized conformers
all2.xyz: output with semiempirically optimized conformers

For alignments
all3.xyz: alignments of ligand and metal center
all4.xyz: chelated structures
all5.xyz: lowest energy chelated structures


qmake1M : creates submision file for conformers 

run.qsh : submision file (use qsub run.qsh)

scratch folder required (generated when qmake1M is ran)

for allignment:
target.xyz : contains fixed .xyz
ADD : contains atoms to be alligned. to the left is test.xyz and to the right target.xyz
alignment runs on OMP_NUM_THREADS squared. (if 16 cores then this should be 4)
